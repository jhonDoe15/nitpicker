# Slice 8: gate on changed coverage

Part of the [Java preset guide](../java-preset.md).

- **Tool and report.** No new tool: the JaCoCo XML of slice 1 already has, per source line, the
  covered and missed branch outcomes (`<line nr mb cb>`). The init script is unchanged.
- **Findings.** `ingestJacocoBranches` (`languages/java/ingest/coverage-reports/jacoco-branches.mjs`) emits one enforceable
  `jacoco` / `changed-branch-coverage` finding per source line whose covered branch outcomes are
  below 95% (the TypeScript check's minimum); lines without branches are never reported. It runs on
  both snapshots, so a branch that is uncovered on the base is baselined like any other finding.
- **What makes it "changed": the head-vs-base line mapping.** The differential comparison already
  maps head lines to the merge base through `git diff --unified=0` (`readChangedLines`, used for
  the strict-preset rules). `touchedCode.isStrictRule(rule, finding)` now also answers true for
  this rule when the finding comes from `jacoco` (`isTouchedCodeRule` in `shared/policy.mjs`), so an
  uncovered branch whose head line lies in a changed range, or in an added file, is new even if
  the base had it. An uncovered branch on an unchanged line stays baselined. The library entry
  `runJavaDiff` passes the same `touchedCode` as the CLI path. The TypeScript check of the same
  rule name is unaffected (its identity keys on branch source; the predicate is tool-scoped).
- **The `main` method.** Branch coverage is judged there as everywhere else: a `main` that only
  passes `System.out` to the code it starts has no branch, and one with branches needs a test (the
  `static void main` exemption of [Slice 7](#slice-7-mutation-with-pit) covers mutants, not branches).
- **Identity.** A hash of the line's source text without formatting (tokens, so spacing, `;` and
  trailing commas do not count), `branch-source:<16 hex>`,
  with `#2`, `#3` for identical lines in one file, in order. No line number: inserting code above
  keeps the finding baselined (the lines around it are not in a changed range), and a renamed file
  follows the rename map because the path is not part of the hash. Editing the line changes both
  the identity and the changed range, so it is new.
- **Granularity and limits.** JaCoCo reports branch outcomes per line, so a line with several
  branches (`a && b || c`) is judged on all of its outcomes together; a method-level view is not
  used. A line that is only reformatted (google-java-format or palantir, with no line split or join
  on the branch line itself) keeps its identity and does not count as changed. Lines whose source text is empty after
  trimming are ignored. Coverage comes from the tests of the snapshot being analyzed, so a test
  that is added or removed changes which branches are covered on head.
- **Tests.** `languages/java/ingest/coverage-reports/jacoco-branches.test.mjs` (sample report, identity stability,
  baselined / touched / added / moved cases through `compareFindings`); `java-reports.test.mjs`
  for the glue; the gated e2e test adds three cases (moved line baselined, edited line fails, new
  uncovered branch fails while the old one stays baselined).
